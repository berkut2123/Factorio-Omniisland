robot-loop-info=Construction robots can be deployed from a roboport. They can automatically build entities from ghosts, deconstruct marked entities, and repair damage with repair packs.

place-roboport-goal=Build a roboport and insert construction robots.
roboport-no-electricity=Outside electric network coverage.

place-construction-bot=Build a construction robot.

notice-robot-info=The construction robot will now dock at the nearest roboport.

build-ghost-radar=Build an entity ghost of a radar in the construction range of the roboport.
build-ghost-radar-info=Use '__CONTROL__build-ghost__' while holding a radar in your cursor.

notice-radar-ghost=An entity ghost is a pseudo-entity in the world, and acts as a plan for where an entity will be built.\n\nWhen an entity ghost is within the construction range of a logistics system, the ghost will be added as a construction job. If the system has the item to build the ghost, and available construction robots, it will dispatch a construction bot to build it.

build-storage-chest=Build a logistics storage chest in the logistic area of the roboport.

insert-radar=Put a radar into the storage chest.

notice-storage-chest=The storage chest is now providing the radar to the logistics system.

notice-working-robot=Since the system now has the item to fulfill the construction request, the robot is dispatched to pick up the radar item.

notice-robot-built-entity=The robot will now take the item to the radar ghost, and build the radar.

notice-robot-return=The robot will then travel to the closest roboport to charge and dock.

place-ghost-entities-goal=Build transport belt ghosts.\n__1__ of __2__
place-ghost-entities-info=While holding an item in your cursor, press __CONTROL__build-ghost__ to place a ghost entity.

insert-belts-goal=Put some transport belts into the storage chest.

make-blueprint-goal=Create a blueprint of some belts.
make-blueprint-info=While holding an empty blueprint in your cursor, hold __CONTROL__select-for-blueprint__ and drag the mouse to create a selection box around the entities you want to include in the blueprint.
make-blueprint-info-2=Then click the 'Create blueprint' button.
confirm-button-tooltip=This is what the 'Create blueprint' button looks like.

build-blueprint-goal=Build ghost entities using the blueprint
build-blueprint-info=Press __CONTROL__build__ while holding a blueprint in the cursor to build the entity ghosts. You can press __CONTROL__rotate__ to rotate the placement direction of the blueprint.

deconstruct-entities-goal=Deconstruct entities using the deconstruction planner
deconstruct-entities-info=While holding a deconstruction planner in your cursor, hold __CONTROL__select-for-blueprint__ and drag the mouse to create a selection box around the entities you want to deconstruct.
deconstruct-entities-info-2=The construction robots will then mine the entities and deposit the items into an available storage chest.

cancel-deconstruction-goal=Cancel the belts deconstruction
cancel-deconstruction-info=While holding a deconstruction planner in your cursor, hold __CONTROL__select-for-cancel-deconstruct__ and drag the mouse to create a selection box around the entities whose deconstruction you want to cancel.

experiment-info=You have been given some items to practice and experiment with the construction robots.\nWhen you are ready to leave the tutorial, press the button below.
finish=Finish

ghost-placed=Entity ghost placed
dispatching-robot=Dispatching construction robot
robot-getting-item=Picking up item
robot-has-item=Heading to build entity
