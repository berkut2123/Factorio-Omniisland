[mod-setting-description]
alien-biomes-terrain-scale=Increase or decrease biome size. Lower values create smaller more frequent biomes. Default is 100.
alien-biomes-temperature-low=The planet's lower temperature extremes. Decrease to add more frozen snow and ice. Increase to make frozen areas less common or impossible. Default is -50.
alien-biomes-temperature-high=The planet's higher temperature extremes. Increase to add more volcanic areas. Decrease to make volcanic areas less common or impossible. Default is 150.
alien-biomes-humidity-low=The planet's lower humidity extremes. Decrease to add more desert. Increase to make desert areas less common or impossible. Default is 0.
alien-biomes-humidity-high=The planet's higher humidity extremes. Increase to add more grass areas. Decrease to make grass areas less common or impossible. Default is 100.
alien-biomes-aux-low=The planet's lower colour variation extremes. Decrease to add more green / brown / tan colours. Increase to make green / brown / tan colours less common. Default is 0.
alien-biomes-aux-high=The planet's higher colour variation extremes. Increase to add more blue / purple / red colours. Decrease to make blue / purple / red colours less common. Default is 100.
alien-biomes-disable-vegetation=If enabled, all grassy terrain, trees, and plant-based decoratives will be removed (unless added by a different mod). This allows you to simulate a dead planet, moon, or asteroid.
alien-biomes-remove-obsolete-tiles=Alien Biomes replaces a lot of the vanilla tiles. The obsolete tiles can be removed to free up additional tile slots so more mods that add tiles can be used (there is a limit of 255 tiles). Doing so might cause problems with other mods that require those vanilla tiles.
alien-biomes-reduced-tiles=Reduced Tile Variants
tile-speed-reduction=Some tiles (like hot volcanic terrain) reduce player speed. Reducing this number means the terrain will slow you less.
