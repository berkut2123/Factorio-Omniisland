# Upgrade Builder and Planner

Continuation of the [Upgrade Builder and Planner](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/upgrade-planner) mod.

Using the selection tool 'Upgrade Builder' you can select items to upgrade. Set your configuration using the mod menu, accessed with the button in the top left or the upgrade planner hotkey ('U' by default)

Then select items to upgrade, and they will be upgraded using items from your inventory.
By holding 'Shift' while selecting an area, the upgrade will be performed using construction robots.
