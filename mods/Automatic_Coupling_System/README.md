# Automatic-Coupling-System

Hey Guys,

this is one of the Parts of my old Trains Modification.
With this Modification you can Couple and Decouple Trains via the Circuit Network.

A example Savegame is here, but this Savegame only works with my Modification [Simple Circuit Trains](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Simple_Circuit_Trains)!

[Savegame]( http://luzifersenpai.de/Testworld.zip)

## How it works:
 - If you want to Couple you send the Coupling Signal
 - If you want to Uncouple you send the Uncoupling Signal with the Strength of how many you want to Uncouple.
 - Like in the GIF below it sends a Signal Strength of 10.
 - ITS NOT DESIGNED FOR SINGLE HEADED TRAINS!!!
