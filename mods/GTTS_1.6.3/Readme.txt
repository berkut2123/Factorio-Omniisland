GTTS 1.6.2 2020-12-25
=====================

This mod changes all available prototype speeds and durations to
effectively change the duration of one game tick. This allows
players to speed up slow factories by increasing the ammount of
time the game has to calculate the tick without haivng to delay
the game, or allows the game to be played at higher framerates
for players that have high refresh rate monitors.

Due to item locations on belts being quantized to 1/256 of a tile,
accurate item movement on belts requires a UPS value of 480/x.
Suggested UPS for belt accuracy are:

480, 240, 160, 120, 96, 80, 60, 48, 40, 32, 30, 24, 20, 19.2, 16, 15 and 12

The mod is somewhat limited in what it can change, so references
to speeds or rates will be incorrect based on the ratio between
the target UPS and the base 60 UPS. If for example a boiler lists
it's energy consumption as 7.2 MW it effectively means that it
will use 7.2 MJ in 60 ticks. At 30 UPS this will take 2 seconds
in wall time, which matches with the normal rate of 3.6 MW at 60
UPS. Because all production and consumption rates are adjusted
equally, everything balances out to work at the original Factorio
ratios. Unfortunately train schedules are going to be incorrect
as well, as they are again based on 1 second being equal to 60
ticks.

Some things in Factorio are tick sensitive. For example a inserter
dropping a stack of items onto a transport belt cannot drop more
than one item every tick. That means that if the belt moves
further than the width of one item in that tick, the belt will
not be fully compressed. This may compound with other belt
compression problems that were introduced in 0.16, and will
certainly impact very fast modded belts like those in Bob's Mods.
Conversely running the game at a higher UPS tends to reduce some
of these problems, and in previous versions I have gotten full
throughput into and out of Factorissimo buildings, and full
compression on loaders even when using the fastest of Bob's
Mods belts.

Factorio 0.17 introduced a new fluid flow system, but there is
currently no way of changing fluid flow speeds. This will be
UPS sensitive unless that changes. At low UPS (below 60) fluid
will flow slower, and high UPS (above 60) fluid will flow faster.
This could have a big impact on the performance of fluid limited
builds, espeically nuclear power.

Some of the changes this mod makes are saved in the game file.
By default this is limited to only the game speed, so a simple
"/c game.speed = 1" command on the console can return the game
speed of a modded save to the original 60 UPS. However you can
also use the "Reset Game Speed" map specific option to
immediately reset the game speed to 60 UPS, as well as disable
any other save game stored adjustments like hand crafting speed
before saving the game so that the mod can be disabled with
minimal disruption.

In safe mode no runtime events are added, meaning the mod can
make no changes beyond those made to prototypes when factorio
loads. Game Speed must be adjusted manually, along with any hand
crafting speeds.

Commands:

/c game.speed = {target-ups} / 60
/c game.player.character.character_crafting_speed_modifier = 60 / {target-ups} - 1
