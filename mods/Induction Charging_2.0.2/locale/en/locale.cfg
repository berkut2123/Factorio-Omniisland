induction-charging-shadow-rate=Update position every ... ticks [img=info]

[mod-setting-description]
induction-charging-update-rate=The amount of ticks between performing full scans of every equipment grid to calculate the required power draw. Lowering this value may improve the visual performance of power graphs and the charge levels in the coils, but will [color=red]dramatically[/color] increase lag. It is therefore [font=default-bold]strongly[/font] recommended to not lower it below 60.\n\n(There are 60 ticks per second.)
induction-charging-shadow-rate=The amount of ticks between the repositioning of the invisible accumulator to the position of the entity it is shadowing. Decreasing this value may improve accuracy, but can [color=red]dramatically[/color] increase lag.\nIt is [font=default-bold]strongly[/font] recommended to leave it at 30.\n\n(There are 60 ticks per second.)
