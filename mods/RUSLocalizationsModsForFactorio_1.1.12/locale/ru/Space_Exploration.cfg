page_space_exploration_text_1=Welcome to Space Exploration. There's a lot in the mod already, but it is still experimental status and is under heavy development. It is not advisable to play with mods other than the required and recommended mods.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Recommended mods[/font] \n\nAAI Signal Transmission: Allows you to transmit signal across surfaces. Without this mod interplanetary logistics will be much more difficult. \n\nGrappling Gun: It pulls you to the target spot. Great for getting over cliffs, into spaceships, and back to space platform if you fall off.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Recommended settings[/font]\n\nYou MUST have all alien biomes terrain tiles enabled, otherwise the game will crash at a later point.\n\nAs the game is longer than normal, it is a good idea to start a game with low enemy evolution factors.\n\nYou should not set high resources settings for your starting planet unless you are playing with resource intensive recipes, such as high difficulty recipes or marathon mode. If resources are set too high it will reduce the need to expand to other planets.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Helpful urls[/font]\n\nTake a look at the Space Exploration Wiki over here: https://spaceexploration.miraheze.org\n\nGet help or follow the development on Discord: https://discord.gg/ymjUVMv\n\nOver 2000 hours have gone into this mod.

title_meteor_defence=Meteor Defence
page_meteor_defence_text_1=Meteors hit most zones at random intervals. You can change the max interval between strikes in mod settings.\n\nThe number of meteors is also random, 50% for 1, 25% for 2, 12.5% for 3, 6.25% for 4, etc...\n\nThe meteor defence structures can shoot at meteors. They fire in sequence, so later defences won't fire if all the meteors were destroyed. Defences require ammo, charge time, and additional power while charging. The power draw is not insignificant, so it is wise to balance risk against cost.
menu_coremining=[img=item/se-core-miner] Core Mining
title_coremining=Core Mining
page_coremining_text_1=Core mining can only be done on planets and moons. Each planet and moon can give a different type of core fragment depending on what is inside. Nauvis gives a balance of common resources but other places tend to mainly give 1 resource type. Core miners are power hungry, but you do get some energy back from the coal, oil, and uranium.\n\nCore miners use a lot of power, plus each core miner you place on a planet reduces the efficiency of all core miners on that same planet. They are much less power efficient than normal miners even if you have multiple running, but they never run out of resources. In the early game it can be useful to have 1 core miner running when you have excess power. If you start on a tiny planet, then solar and core mining might be your only way to get enough resources to get off the planet.\n\nLate game core miners benefit greatly from mining productivity bonuses. It is better to aim for a few on many planets rather than many on a few planets.
menu_launching_satellites=[img=item/satellite] Launching Satellites
title_launching_satellites=Launching Satellites
page_launching_satellites_text_1=You have launched [color=cyan]__1__[/color] satellites.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=virtual-signal/se-remote-view] Navigation Satellite Uplink [__CONTROL__se-remote-view__][/font]\n\nWhen you launch a Navigation Satellite into space from the Satellite Rocket Silo, you get access to the [img=virtual-signal/se-remote-view] Navigation Satellite View. This mode can be accessed with the [__CONTROL__se-remote-view__] key. While in satellite mode your camera is detached from your character so you can quickly look around the map and even uncover new areas. There are some things you can't do in satellite mode, like directly place or mine entities. There is a lot you can do though, like use blueprints, destruction planners, place ghost entities, order wire connections, change machine recipes, combinator settings, etc.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit]Universe Explorer [__CONTROL__se-universe-explorer__][/font]\n\nThe Navigation Satellite network also lets you view other surfaces, like other planets, moons, asteroid belts, asteroid fields, and orbits. Press [__CONTROL__se-universe-explorer__] to bring up the list of known zones. If you have launched a satellite then you can click View Surface to see what is there. It can be good to scout a planet a bit before you try to fly there.\n\nLaunching satellites also helps with zone discovery within the system it is launched from (see Zone Discovery for more details).
menu_zone_discovery=[img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] Zone Discovery
title_zone_discovery=Zone Discovery
page_zone_discovery_text_1=There are lots of stars, planets, moons, asteroid belts, and asteroid fields in this area of space that can be discovered.\n\n[font=heading-2]Navigation Satellite[/font]\nYou can launch a navigation satellite to discover a random planet, moon, or asteroid belt in the same star system that the satellite was launched from. If there is nothing else to discover in that system then it can discover new stars instead, but cannot discover anything orbiting other stars or anything in deep space.\n\n[font=heading-2]Zone Discovery Research[/font]\nYou can use space telescopes to look for new zones to discover. This is achieved through "Zone Discover" research. The basic zone discovery research can find a random star, planet, moon, or asteroid belt.\n\n[font=heading-2]Targeted Zone Discovery Research[/font]\nTargeted zone discovery research is the same as the basic research, but if you have selected a resource preference (below) it look in areas more likely for that resource to occur so you are more likely to discover a zone with that resource. Keep in mind that a planet can't be discovered before discovering its star, and a moon can't be discovered before discovering its planet. Don't expect to find what you're looking for every time.\n\n[font=heading-2]Deep Space Zone Discovery Research[/font]\nDeep space zone discovery research only looks for areas of interest in deep space and is the only way you can discover asteroid fields. Asteroid fields are the only place you can find Naquitite. Deep space research cannot be resource targeted.\n\n[font=heading-2]Resource targeted zone discovery preference:[/font]
menu_cargo_rockets=[img=virtual-signal/se-cargo-rocket] Cargo Rockets
title_cargo_rockets=Cargo Rockets
page_cargo_rockets_text_1=You have launched [color=cyan]__1__[/color] cargo rockets.\n\nCargo rockets are launched from a Cargo Rocket Silo, aka the Launchpad. To make a Cargo Rocket you need to insert 100 cargo rocket sections and 1 space capsule into the cargo rocket silo.\n\nTo launch the rocket you also need to put in a lot of liquid rocket fuel via 1 of the 8 connections near the corners. The amount of fuel required varies depending the gravity of the plant you are on, and the distance between you and the destination.\n\nIf you are automating cargo rocket loading, be careful not to fill it with cargo rocket sections. A wire leading from the silo counts all rocket parts used in the rocket as well as ones in the inventory. Inserting with a condition of components < 100 will make the inserter stop when the rocket is built. (Devnote: This setup is not ideal but the other options are worse.)
menu_lifesupport=[img=item/se-lifesupport-equipment-1] Lifesupport
title_lifesupport=Lifesupport
page_lifesupport_text_1=Lifesupport is gained from lifesupport equpment and lifesupport canisters. You need both to survive in hostile environments.\n\nLifesupport equipment and the consumable canisters can be made in a lifesupport facility.\n\nLifesupport canisters provide the resources needed by the system to fulfil all of its roles and are consumed gradually. As the lifesupport bar decreases, new canisters are consumed directly from your inventory. \n\nLifesupport equipment is placed into the grid of armor, however if you are using a thrustersuit, it has 1 lifesupport equipment built in. Additional lifesupport equipment pieces placed in the equipment grid increase the lifesupport efficiency. If you are using lifesupport equipment in a non-thruster suit then it will protect you on hostile planets but won’t protect you from the vacuum of space.\n\n[font=heading-2]Hostile environments[/font]\nHostile environments are any area that would cause damage to your body just by being there. Lifesupport equipment is designed to protect you from these hazards by providing you with appropriate pressurisation, oxygen, water, nutrition, thermal regulation, and radiation protection. The 2 main types of hostile environment are:\n\nSpace: A space suit (thruster suit) is required for lifesupport to function correctly in a vacuum. You cannot use lifesupport from some other type of armor in space, you will still suffocate.\n\nLand: Certain planets and moons may have dangers such as radiation, extreme cold, extreme heat, or an acidic atmosphere, and require lifesupport equipment. (Coming soon). Planets also require lifesupport if certain bio weapons are used (Plague Worlds). Lifesupport for these areas can be provided by a thruster suit, or by equipment placed into any other type of armor.
menu_space_sciences=[img=item/se-rocket-science-pack] Space Sciences
title_space_sciences=Space Sciences
page_space_sciences_text_1=[img=item/se-rocket-science-pack] The first in-space science is the rocket science pack. It can only be made in space so you need to establish a small space station to produce it. Rocket science packs and the later science packs can only be used in space, so you'll need to rocket up other science packs too and put them in the powerful Space science lab.\n\n[font=heading-2]Specialist Sciences[/font]\n\nThe 4 specialist sciences are Astronomic, Biological, Energy and Material. They are all data-driven, and follow a process of performing experiments to gather data for supercomputers to build an increasingly accurate model of life, the universe, and everything. They are all at approximately the same tech levels so you are free to choose your order of development, however, each one requires a specific resource to some degree, so take a look at your solar system before deciding which science to research first.\n\n[img=item/se-astronomic-science-pack-4] Astronomic science focusses mainly on space logistics.\n\n[img=item/se-energy-science-pack-4] Energy science is mainly in energy production, power transfer, and high tech gadgets.\n\n[img=item/se-material-science-pack-4] Material science is focussed more on heavy industry and direct upgrades.\n\n[img=item/se-biological-science-pack-4] Biological science is focussed on character upgrades, medicine, lifesupport, bioweapons, and productivity.\n\n[font=heading-2]Deep space science[/font]\n\n[img=item/se-deep-space-science-pack]Deep space science is a work in progress. It will have additional data-driven recipes at a later date.
menu_energy_beams=[img=item/se-energy-transmitter-emitter] Energy Beams
title_energy_beams=Energy Beams
page_energy_beams_text_1=[font=heading-2]Coronal Mass Ejections[/font]\nStars in the area frequently eject dangerous streams of particles. It is not uncommon for a planet or moon to stray into one of these particle streams. If you have a base on an affected surface you should evacuate, diversify and disperse your assets, or build an Umbrella defence facility with a large accumulator backup. When a surface is threatened there will be at least 4 hours early warning. Known threats will be listed below.
page_energy_beam_warning_text=[img=virtual-signal/se-star] Warning: Coronal mass ejection heading for __1__. Estimated energy for defence: __3__GJ. ETA: __2__s.
page_energy_beams_text_2=[font=heading-2]Umbrella: Energy Beam Defence[/font]\nThe energy beam defence facility, "Umbrella", can protect against coronal mass ejections and space-based energy beam weapons. It works by levitating magnetic particles into a protective bubble, then realignes and clumps the particles as needed to diffuse hostile energy beams. The only requirement to function is energy, the base draw is 10MW but increases based on the strength of attacking beams. Only 1 is needed per surface against Coronal mass ejections, against energy beams weapons 1 Umbrella can defend against up to 500GJ of attacking power. For a coronal mass ejection, the base power requirement for a 5000 radius planet and 100% solar, is expected be around 160GJ over 2 minutes with a peak power draw of 2GW at the 1 minute mark. This is increased or decreased with the zone's solar power multiplier, and for solid bodies it is increased or decreased based on the radius relative to a base radius of 5000. For an energy beam from an Energy Beam Emitter, the power requirement is expected to be 1/10th of the energy beam strength at the target (after efficiency loss).\n\n[font=heading-2]Energy Beaming[/font]\nThe Energy Beam emitter is capable of sending energy to different surface. It can do this in 2 main ways, either as a way to provide power to a distant surface, "Energise", or as a cutting beam weapon, "Glaive". When in Glaive mode the beam damages an areas continuously but can be moved over the target surface cutting a path. The damage rate, area, and beam speed increase based on the energy put into the beam. "Auto-Glaive" mode has autonomous target selection.\n\nAn Energy beam emitter has 4 connection points where Energy beam chambers can connect end-on. Energy beam chambers can connect length-ways, or have a long edge meet the middle of a short edge, but cannot connect directly side-to-side. Energy beam injectors attach directly to the sides of Energy beam chambers. Each Energy beam injector increases the power of the connected Energy beam emitter. To collect power from a beam you need an Energy beam receiver at the target surface and select it as the target using the targeter from the emitter. Once the beam has the receiver as the target the receiver will heat up. The heat can be taken from heat connections at the side to power heat exchangers and turbines.
menu_spaceships=[img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship] Spaceships
title_spaceships=Spaceships
page_spaceships_text_1=Spaceships are huge, powerful vehicles that can launch many contained structures, items, and players into space, then rocket around the solar system to land on other surfaces.\n\n[font=heading-2]Spaceship Construction[/font]\nSpaceships are made from many tiles and smaller components that fit together to make a spaceship of your own design. You design a spaceship almost like a mini moveable base.\n\nStart with a floorplan of spaceship flooring. Don't build too big, as your first few spaceships will have strict size restrictions, expandable by research. Place spaceship walls around the edges to make bulkheads, and make sure there are no gaps (including diagonals). Place a spaceship console somewhere in the inside, this is the core part of the spaceship and how you control it. When the console is placed, there are some pulses as the console figures out what parts are properly attached, what parts are properly contained and what will fall off if you try to launch. If any squares flash red, then there is an issue with your design, which you can diagnose by checking the spaceship console. You also need a spaceship rocket booster tank, and a spaceship rocket engine. The booster tank is what stores the fuel you need to get into space and provides the VTOL component. The rocket engines are for the slower burn though space to get you to your destination. Some form of defence in the front (always north) is also advisable because the nebula you are in is full of debris.\n\n[font=heading-2]Integrity Stress[/font]\nEarly on, you will be very limited on spaceship size by the Integrity Stress limits of your technology level. Additional technology lets you build larger spaceships. Integrity stress is calculated in 2 parts: A. The size of the ship. B. The cargo capacity of the ship. The total integrity stress is whichever stress factor is larger, the two values are not added together.\n\n[font=heading-2]Long Haul Activities[/font]\nWhen considering long distance travel, it is worth noting that you can do a lot in satellite mode while your body is in transit. You can also give orders to spaceships remotely via the satellite uplink.\n\n[font=heading-2]Crafting Machines[/font]\n[color=#ffaaaa]Warning: A crafting machine designed for space will only be able to use recipes shared by other land structures if the spaceship is on land. If a space-based recipe is set while the spaceship lands, the ingredients will be lost. Some land-based crafting machines can function in space, but they will lose the ability to use productivity modules while in space. If the spaceship launches with productivity modules in these machines, the productivity modules are destroyed.[/color]\n\n[font=heading-2]Spaceship Signals[/font]\nThe top right section of the spaceship console can be connected with wires separately from the main structure, as it outputs its own signals:\n[img=item/se-spaceship-console] The console number indicates the spaceship's ID.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] The speed signal number indicates the spaceship's speed: -1 if stopped, -2 if anchored.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-distance] The distance signal indicates the distance to the selected destination: -1 if arrived, -2 if anchored, -3 if no destination is set.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] A fourth signal indicates the current destination, if any.\n\n[font=heading-2]Spaceship Automation[/font]\nThe main structure of the console can accept signal inputs:\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] The speed signal sets a target speed and engages the engines.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship-launch] A Spaceship launch signal triggers a launch.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] A destination signal sets the destination (you can see a zone's signal from the Universe Explorer side panel once you have constructed a spaceship).\nTo cause a spaceship to land, the console must be given a pair of anchor signals, either [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp] "anchor using left clamp" with [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-right-clamp] "anchor to right clamp", or [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-right-clamp] "anchor using right clamp" with [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-left-clamp] "anchor to left clamp". The values of the signals must match the values of a clamp on the ship and a clamp at the destination. You can see and change these values by opening a clamp's UI. If a match is found, then the ship will try to land with the two clamps connected. Use with caution.

page_journal_text_backstory=I found myself crash-landed on an unfamiliar planet with parts of a small ship burning around me. My body was bruised, scratched and singed, but nothing too serious. My head injury was apparently more serious, a pounding headache and the light was blinding. Worse still, I couldn't remember how I got here, or even who I was beyond a name and a vague sense of purpose... to build. Even then, I couldn't remember what to build or how to build it. At first I thought my head had been damaged in the crash and the memories would come back, but they still haven't. The fact that my data logs were also empty or reformatted had me thinking of other explanations.

page_journal_title_entered_vault=Relic hunting
page_journal_text_entered_vault=I entered a cavern beneath the pyramid-shaped protrusion on __1__ and found a dark and dangerous chamber. The chamber had two ancient cartouches on the ground, one large and one was small. They both had multiple glyphs on their surface along with other circles and lines. The glyph at the center of the large cartouche seemed to be the most significant in whatever information the system was trying to convey. Whatever the information is, it is formatted unlike anything else I've seen. Behind the cartouches was some kind raised cylinder containing a powerful device that I can use as a module. Modules of this quality are so valuable that it is worth trying to find more of these structures. Maybe it is time for some archeology.
page_journal_title_found_gate=Anomaly
page_journal_text_found_gate=Some sort of huge ring-shaped artifact was found in the anomaly. Two things are immediately obvious even from a distance: 1. It is ancient. 2. The technology is completely different from my own. Whatever it is or was, it is destroyed now.

page_journal_text_found_gate_ship=Part of a fairly large derelict spaceship was found in the anomaly near the ring-shaped artifact.

page_starmapping_text_1=Starmapping is achieved by repeatedly researching the technology: [img=technology/se-long-range-star-mapping] [color=cyan]Long Range Star Mapping[/color]. This research looks for interesting patterns of stars in other galaxies. Does this have any practical use? Probably not.\n\nCoordinates are given in Standard Vector (SV) format, aligned based on cosmic background radiation.\n\nYou have mapped [color=cyan]__1__[/color] notable patterns so far.
