page_jetpack_text_1=Jetpacks are pieces of equipment you can put into your armor grid.\n\nIf you have a jetpack in your equipment grid and fuel in your inventory then you can press __CONTROL__jetpack__ to start flying. Accepted fuels are rocket fuel and nuclear fuel. [color=0.5,0.7,0.8](Some modded fuels can also be used, such as AAI Industry's Processed Fuel.)[/color]\n\nFlying lets you move over obstacles and water. While flying you have momentum so it is harder to make sudden turns but you can reach higher speeds.\n\nThere are 4 tiers of jet pack, higher tier jetpacks provide increased thrust. You can put multiple jetpack equipment pieces into the same equipment grid to increase your speed further. [color=0.5,0.7,0.8](Jetpack stacking can be disabled with a mod option.)[/color]\n\nThe final acceleration value of a jetpack is reduced by weight, which is mainly influenced by armor grid size. The acceleration value is displayed when you take off. [color=0.5,0.7,0.8](A per-player mod setting can disable the alert.)[/color]\n\nJetpacks interfere with shields, the faster you go the more your shields are reduced. The shield reduction is percentage based and does not count as damage. [color=0.5,0.7,0.8](Shield reduction multiplier can be controlled with a mod option.)[/color]\n\nUsing a jetpack in combat can be very powerful, but you need to be carfeul; if you take damage while flying you can get knocked to the ground. [color=0.5,0.7,0.8](A mod setting can disable this effect.)[/color]
