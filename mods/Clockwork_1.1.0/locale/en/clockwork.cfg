[mod-setting-description]
Clockwork-cycle-length=Multiplier on the total length of a day/night solar cycle. A vanilla day is 6 minutes, 56.6 seconds. Example: setting this to 4 will result in a 27 minute 47 second day.\nWarning: You can change this setting at any time, but accumulator capacity modification requires a restart.
Clockwork-dusk=Time when dusk starts. These values cannot be equal and must be in this order from least to greatest:\ndusk -> evening -> morning -> dawn.\nBy default, 0.5 (the midpoint between evening and morning) is midnight.
Clockwork-evening=Time when evening starts. The night is darkest after this time. These values cannot be equal and must be in this order from least to greatest:\ndusk -> evening -> morning -> dawn.\nFor a longer night, make Evening and Morning further apart.
Clockwork-morning=Time when morning starts. The darkest night is over after this time. These values cannot be equal and must be in this order from least to greatest:\ndusk -> evening -> morning -> dawn.
Clockwork-dawn=Time when dawn starts. These values cannot be equal and must be in this order from least to greatest:\ndusk -> evening -> morning -> dawn.
Clockwork-permanight=Neverending night mode. Once it sets, the sun never rises.\nDisable while a map is running to resume the normal day/night cycle.
Clockwork-permanight-grace=Delay before the first night comes in minutes. For use with 'Sun Never Rises'.\nChanging this while a map is running will restart the grace period from the beginning.
Clockwork-permanight-grace-warn=Provides a warning when the neverending night is coming.
Clockwork-mod-accumulators=Adjusts the capacity of accumulators to be proportionate to the new overall cycle length.
Clockwork-mod-accumulators-capacity=Capacity multiplier of accumulator. This should usually be the same as "Daylength Multiplier", but exists as a separate setting since accumulators cannot be changed dynamically.
Clockwork-enable-flares=Enables an early game light source: flare capsules that can be thrown. Duration scales with the accumulator capacity multiplier.
Clockwork-flares-simple=Simplifies the flare recipe such that electronic circuits won't be required. This is intended for use with mods that make circuits much more difficult to achieve (Such as Bob, Angels, Krastorio, Py, Dyworld, etc), as flares are intended to be an early light source.
Clockwork-starttime=Time of day the game will start at. Default of 0.0 is high noon (12:00pm) with vanilla dawn and dusk settings. This should not be set to night time if you're using "Grace Before First Night". This setting only takes effect on a new game, or when Sun Never Rises is changed to enabled.
Clockwork-darknight=Nights are completely black - nothing can be seen without lights.
Clockwork-multisurface=Clockwork will attempt to determine which surfaces represent outdoors areas (such as other planets), and apply its settings to all of these surfaces. Disable this if Clockwork interferes with surfaces other mods add.
Clockwork-disable-nv=Disables the power armor nightvision recipe and technology. Factorio will crash if no nightvision item/equipment exists, so if this setting is enabled in a running game, already-built NV is rendered inert rather than removed.
Clockwork-darknight-percent=Allows for pitch black nights, or something in-between.\n\n100% is complete darkness, 0% is vanilla Factorio darkness.
