    "description": "Instead of 85~115, 185~215, 285~315. Coolant tower recipes now accept all temperature range: 25~150, 150~250, 250~infinity. Good to combat bugs that affects coolant temperatures. (Original proposed for a bug in Klonan's Transport Drones mod, where transported coolant cools down by itself)"
