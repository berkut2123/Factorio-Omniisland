ammo-nano-deconstructors=Deconstructs any entities marked for deconstruction in range. Will return items to you.
ammo-nano-constructors=Revives entity ghosts in range if you have the entitys place item in your inventory. Also repairs damaged entities.
equipment-bot-chip-items=Configures personal roboports to automatically mark items on the ground for pickup. Must be in a network with available robots. Items do not get marked if enemies are around.
equipment-bot-chip-trees=Configures personal roboports to automatically mark trees in range for deconstruction. Must be in a network with available robots. Items do not get marked if enemies are around.
equipment-bot-chip-launcher=Configures personal roboports to automatically start launching combat units from inventory when enemies are inside range. Requires a personal roboport to work.
equipment-bot-chip-feeder=Emergency feeder, will automatically use healing items when your health is low, each feeder has a 2 minute cooldown. Requires a personal roboport to work.
equipment-bot-chip-nanointerface=Allows nanobots to work inside logistic cells. Only 1 chip is needed.
