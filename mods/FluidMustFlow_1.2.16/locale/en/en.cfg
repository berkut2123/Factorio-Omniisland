[mod-setting-description]
	fmf-enable-duct-invariant=If enabled, except for connection point, the main duct parts and fragments could be connected only with other of the same type. If the option is disabled, u could connect every part to smaller pipes (default: enabled)
	fmf-enable-duct-join=RECOMMENDED! If enabled, join 2 ducts 2x1 into one 2x2, and 2 ducts 2x2 into one 2x4, this option will transform automatically small entity in the bigger version. If enabled also, disable the recipes of 2x2 and 2x4 ducts, because the mod will place it when necessary automatically (default: enabled)
	fmf-underground-duct-max-length=Max distance of underground duct (default: 30)
	fmf-duct-health-multiplier=DON'T TOUCH THIS OPTION IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING! Change ducts health with formula: multiplier*tiles occupied*2 (default multiplier: 4)
	fmf-duct-base-level-multiplier=DON'T TOUCH THIS OPTION IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING! Change ducts base level with formula: multiplier*tiles occupied*height*2 (default multiplier: 4)
