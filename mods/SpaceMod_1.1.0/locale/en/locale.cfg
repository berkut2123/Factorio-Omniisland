spacex-completion-text1=You didn't crash the ship in the first place, right? That was Bob your trusty construction robot. He was the one flying the last ship. Him and his trusty AI that you programed. It was his fault! 
spacex-completion-text2=Well he didn't make it through the first crash, so now it is completely up to you.  You were paying attention during your training of "How to fly a large tin can" right?

SpaceX-research=SpaceX research cost multiplier
SpaceX-production=SpaceX production cost multiplier
SpaceX-launch-profile=SpaceX launch profile
SpaceX-ignore-tech-multiplier=SpaceX ignore tech price multiplier
SpaceX-no-space-sci=SpaceX remove space science from ftl drive technology
SpaceX-cheaper-fusion-reactor=SpaceX cheaper fusion reactor
SpaceX-no-bob=No Bob's mods compatibility
SpaceX-no-popup=Suppress Narrative Popups
SpaceX-auto-continue=Auto-continue on

[mod-setting-description]
SpaceX-game-mode=SpaceX main difficulty settings.  Classic will give a 0.14 equivalent experience, SpaceX Plus increases research cost 4x production cost 2x and requires 5x launch profile, SpaceX Extreme increases research cost 16x, production cost 16x and launches required 25x.
SpaceX-research-cost=Research cost multiplier.
SpaceX-production-cost=Production cost multiplier.
SpaceX-launch-profile=Required number of launches : classic is v0.14 numbers, launch mania is all classic numbers x 5, launch meglo mania is all classic numbers x 25. eg launch mania requires 35 satellites, 50 drydock components and 5 ftl drives etc
SpaceX-ignore-tech-multiplier=SpaceX tech prices are fixed and unaffected by changes to the vanilla game's technology price multiplier used for marathon games.  By default this multiplier is in addition to the SpaceX research cost multiplier, so check this to vary the costs independently (makes marathon SpaceX games easier).
SpaceX-no-space-sci=By default the final SpaceX technology now requires Space Science.  Checking this setting will remove the space science requirement from the final technology research (makes game easier).
SpaceX-cheaper-fusion-reactor=The recipe cost of the fusion reactor component is reduced to 40 portable fusion reactors.  This makes them cost 10k processing units (same as in v0.14) rather than 25k processing units that is the standard v0.15 cost (makes game easier).
SpaceX-no-bob=Bob's mods compatibility will not be used in this playthrough
SpaceX-no-popup=If selected then the popups for the completion of the satellite network and the drydock will be suppressed.  (Good for games where you want to launch many FTL craft)
SpaceX-auto-continue=This option will automatically select the 'Bring it on' option when the FTL space craft has been completed.  Also the popup is suppressed - use in conjucntion with the above selection to remove the popups so you can keep launching multiple FTL spacecraft without manual intervention.
