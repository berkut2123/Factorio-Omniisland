power-combinator=This combinator type outputs power consumption and power production statistics of an electric network in watts as signals to the connected combinator networks.\nFollowing unique signals for the connected electric network are provided:\n [virtual-signal=power-factor]: internal prescaling factor X as [font=default-bold]user combinator setting[/font] for each Power Combinator for all values sent to the combinator network\n [virtual-signal=power-consumption]: current consumption rate (W)\n [virtual-signal=power-production]: current production rate (W)\n [virtual-signal=power-max-consumption]: maximal possible consumption rate (W)\n [virtual-signal=power-max-production]: maximal possible production rate (W)\n\nIf the output values are over the scale of 2³¹ then the combinator output doesn't update the stats and the indicator light in right bottom corner will show red. In this case please set the scaling factor to a reasonable value.
