Feeling adventurous? Then check out the new Bio Cannon! Due to recent changes 
in Factorio, it doesn't need any control scripting and should therefore be more 
UPS friendly. As a bonus, you'll see the range when you hover the cursor over 
the bio cannon -- just as with any vanilla turret. It also has a longer range 
(120 instead of 90).

PLEASE NOTE: Factorio >=0.18.33 is required for this! Otherwise, it may happen 
that you waste your expensive ammo on a single biter/spitter.

  control_bio_cannon.lua.18.33
  control.lua.18.33
  data-final-fixes.lua.18.33

  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/entity.lua.18.33
  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/item-group.lua.18.33
  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/item.lua.18.33
  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/recipe.lua.18.33

They make the old, combined entity for the Bio Cannon redundant, but as
attack_target_mask can't be used to limit what entities will be attacked
in earlier versions of Factorio, these files aren't officially active yet.



If you want to try out the new Bio Cannon, replace each of these files:

  control_bio_cannon.lua
  control.lua
  data-final-fixes.lua

  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/entity.lua
  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/item-group.lua
  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/item.lua
  prototypes/Bio_Cannon/recipe.lua

with its counterpart listed above! I've already made a backup of the original
files, so if it doesn't work, just replace the new files with the *.bak version!

Does the new Bio Cannon work as expected? Is the new range OK? (Please keep in 
mind that this is the "prototype artillery": It should be weaker than the 
vanilla artillery turrets, so extending the range even more probably is not a 
good idea.)  Your feedback is very appreciated and will hopefully help to get 
the new Bio Cannon bug-free in time for Factorio 1.0!
