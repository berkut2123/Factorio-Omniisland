BI_Game_Tweaks_Disassemble=Allow some disassemble recipes. You get about 50% of the resources back
BI_Game_Tweaks_Emissions_Multiplier=Bob started this. The general idea is that unprocessed fuels cause more pollution than more refined fules. Thus coal would produce 200% pollution, while solid fuel would produce only 85%. Please see "Fuel Values.xlsx" in mod folder for more info!
