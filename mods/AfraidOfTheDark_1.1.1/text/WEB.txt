Nights are too dark for you ? 
When the shadows come, you're afraid of the BBBB (Big Bad Behemoth Bitter) ? 
You're tired of bumping your head into electrical poles at midnight ? 
Then this mod is for you !!!

You now have three progressive solutions to unveil the shadows :

First, did you notice that, at night, you have an omindirectional light covering a circular area around you, and also a personal light cone ? This mod enforces these personal lights you are carrying with you. It also works when you are inside a vehicle (car, tank, airplane, and also moving locomotives). You can customize this enforcement by editing the config.lua file.

Second, in the middle game, researching "optics" gives you access to a new powerful lamp : the "balloon light", that has a really wider ligthing area than the classical small lamp :

Third, in the later game, researching "night vision" gives you access to another pair of glasses to wear in your armor : the "perfect night glasses". With these, you can see as if it was noon under the sun ! They are very efficients to hunt in nightclubs too, but alas, you are alone on this planet :

And it is even a little smaller than the green military night vision equipement : 2x2 instead of 3x2 !

And now that the night almost vanished, if you cannot tell what hour of the day it is anymore, just check my [url=https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=92&t=22822]Time Tools mod[/url]...[/spoiler]
