# factorio-color-coding

Color-coded indicator lamps, tiles and walls, which can be researched after their base technologies are unlocked.

The primary purpose of the mod is to help organize and color code your factories, though it could also be used decoratively, and the colored lamps may have interesting uses with the circuit network.

The included colors are the same as the built-in set of player colors
